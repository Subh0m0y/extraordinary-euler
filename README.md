# Extraordinary Euler
This project contains the solutions to the questions on [Project Euler]
(https://projecteuler.net) written in Java. All the questions are addressed sequentially and their solutions are provided in their respective packages, in the `Solver` classes. Every `Solver` is an implementation of `BaseSolver` and supports `getAnswer()` and `getBigIntegerAnswer()` methods.
